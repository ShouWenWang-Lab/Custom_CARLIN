OFF-TARGET AMPLIFICATION

Insignificant off-target amplification detected. Only 3% of reads are off-target.

FILTERING

No issues detected at filtering step.

ANALYSIS

Preferential amplification of edited alleles detected. (Reads per edited UMI / reads per unedited UMI) > 2.

Common UMIs account for only 53% of reads. This is likely due to:
 - preferential amplification of edited transcripts causing many reads to be allocated to a few UMIs

RESULTS

Low +Dox induction detected. Only 10% of UMIs reported an edited CARLIN allele.
